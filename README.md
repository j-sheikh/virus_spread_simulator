Project done: August 2020

For the course algorithm and data structure, a fellow student and I build a virus spread simulator based on a cellular automata we had to programm before. Here we represent a urban environment and simulate how a virus, depending on different input values, spreads. Individually adjustable are following variables: 

1)game field size

2)percentage of game field should be populated

3)epochs, how long should the simulation last

4)Lockdown, yes or no. If yes, movement radius of each cell will be reduced to 1.
